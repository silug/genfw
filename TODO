TODO:

    * FIXME - It would probably be good to set the default policy for
              chains in other tables (like nat) to DROP and then add
              explicit rules for accepting packets.
    * FIXME - We should be dropping reserved addresses.
    * FIXME - We should be dropping traffic to/from port 0.
    * FIXME - Handle quotes in insert and append statements (at least).
    * FIXME - The "nat" handling could use some extensions:
              * SNAT from a specific address (other than the default)
              * DNAT (from the outside address or a random address)
    * FIXME - "allow" should handle source ports.
    * FIXME - "allow" should handle ranges of ports.
    * FIXME - There should be an option to specify where to find the
              configuration files.
    * FIXME - I'd like to see this work on Debian (at least).
    * FIXME - "append" and "insert" to non-existent chains should give
              an error
    * FIXME - Related to the last item, we should define the valid
              built-in chains before reading the rules, that way we can
              detect adding to a non-existant chain.
    * FIXME - We should just append/insert our built-in rules before or
              after reading the rules file(s), then just loop over the
              defined (and non-empty) chains on output.
    * FIXME - Do something useful with stop/reload/condrestart/status
              in the init script.
    * FIXME - Getting a lot of this message on recent iptables:

              'iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i foo -d x/y -j DROP'
              failed with exit value 2 at /usr/sbin/genfw line 820.
              iptables v1.4.5: 
              The "nat" table is not intended for filtering, the use
              of DROP is therefore inhibited.


              Try `iptables -h' or 'iptables --help' for more
              information.


    * Maybe make generic "int", "out", and "dmz" chains (and combos of
      those) so we can have generic rules for all int-int, int-out, etc.?
