TODO:

    * FIXME - It would probably be good to set the default policy for
              chains in other tables (like nat) to DROP and then add
              explicit rules for accepting packets.
    * FIXME - We should be dropping reserved addresses.
    * FIXME - We should be dropping traffic to/from port 0.
    * FIXME - Handle quotes in insert and append statements (at least).
    * FIXME - The "nat" handling could use some extensions:
              * SNAT from a specific address (other than the default)
              * DNAT (from the outside address or a random address)
    * FIXME - "allow" should handle source ports.
    * FIXME - "allow" should handle ranges of ports.
    * FIXME - There should be an option to specify where to find the
              configuration files.
    * FIXME - I'd like to see this work on Debian (at least).
    * FIXME - "append" and "insert" to non-existent chains should give
              an error
    * FIXME - Related to the last item, we should define the valid
              built-in chains before reading the rules, that way we can
              detect adding to a non-existant chain.
    * FIXME - Do something useful with stop/reload/condrestart/status
              in the init script.

    * Maybe make generic "int", "out", and "dmz" chains (and combos of
      those) so we can have generic rules for all int-int, int-out, etc.?
    * Add some extra security in the mangle table:

      - Filter out connections to internal addresses from outside interfaces
        that should be NATing.
      - Filter out connections from internal addresses on outside interfaces
        (which should be handled by rp_filter, but still...).
      - Filter out invalid TCP and other bad stuff:

        * All bits are cleared

          -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE

        * SYN & FIN are both set
        
          -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN SYN,FIN

        * SYN & RST are both set
        
          -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST

        * FIN & RST are both set
        
          -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,RST FIN,RST

        * FIN is the only bit set, without the expected accompanying ACK
          (implicitly includes 'xmastree' packets containing FIN-PSH, FIN-
          URG, and FIN-PSH-URG)

          -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,FIN FIN

        * PSH is the only bit set, without the expected accompanying ACK

          -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,PSH PSH

        * URG is the only bit set, without the expected accompanying ACK

          -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,URG URG

        * INVALID?

          -m state --state INVALID

        * Bogon filtering?

          Example at http://www.stearns.org/modwall/sample/bogons-sample

        * TTL normalization?

          -m ttl --ttl-gt 36 -j TTL --ttl-set 64 (as an example)

        * Add some chains of random bad things, but don't call them
          anywhere, just so they'd be handy if anyone wanted to use them?

        * Adding a flag to set what networks are allowed for source
          addresses on a given interface would let us filter and NAT
          automatically.

    * ip6tables support
    * Give all interfaces a numeric value and base our default accept/drop
      decision on that.
