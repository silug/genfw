TODO:

    * FIXME - Maximum prefix length 29 for --log-prefix
    * FIXME - Chain names have a maximum length (30 characters) too
    * FIXME - We should do something useful with inserted or appended
              rules in tables other than filter and nat.
    * FIXME - It would probably be good to set the default policy for
              chains in other tables (like nat) to DROP and then add
              explicit rules for accepting packets.
    * FIXME - We should be dropping reserved addresses.
    * FIXME - We should be dropping traffic to/from port 0.
    * FIXME - Handle quotes in insert and append statements (at least).
    * FIXME - The "nat" handling could use some extensions:
              * SNAT from a specific address (other than the default)
              * DNAT (from the outside address or a random address)
    * FIXME - "allow" should handle source ports.
    * FIXME - "allow" should handle ranges of ports.
    * FIXME - There should be an option to specify where to find the
              configuration files.
    * FIXME - I'd like to see this work on Debian (at least).
    * FIXME - "append" and "insert" to non-existent chains should give
              an error

    * Maybe make generic "int", "out", and "dmz" chains (and combos of
      those) so we can have generic rules for all int-int, int-out, etc.?
